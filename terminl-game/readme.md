## Development

The game is built using Python's curses library for terminal manipulation. Key components:

- `Game` class: Main game logic and state management
- Terminal rendering using curses
- Frame rate control for consistent game speed
- High score system using file I/O

## File Structure

- `new_game.py`: Main game file containing all game logic
- `score.txt`: Generated file that stores the high score
